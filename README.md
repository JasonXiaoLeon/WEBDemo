For Practice
The assignment is about a four-card-layout design. There are no complicated tricks in this application, just a simple layout. More than 3 per line will use flex to switch lines, and there are interactive applications like hover, active, etc.

The second one is about trolley. I just used a click Event and DOM. It can stimulate a operation for adding items, and when it is full it will show a alert.
